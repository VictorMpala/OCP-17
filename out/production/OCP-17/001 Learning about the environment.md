# Major Components of Java 
- Java Development Kit (JDK) contains the minimum software you need to do Java development
	- javac: Converts .java source files into .class bytecode
	- java: Executes the program
	- jar: Packages files together
	- javadoc: Generates documentation
- javac produces bytecode that is run by the java command 
- then java launches the JVM before running the code 
- The JVM knows how to run bytecode on the actual machine it is on
- The JRE was a subset of the JDK that was used for running a program but could
not compile one
- java comes wit many apis such as StringBuilder class to create a large String and a method in Collections to sort a list
